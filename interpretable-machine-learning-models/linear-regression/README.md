# Linear Regression

A linear regression model predicts the target \(dependent variable\) as a weighted sum of the feature inputs \(independent variables\). The linearity of their relationship makes the interpretation easy. Linear regression models are very widely used by statisticians, computer scientists and other people who tackle quantitative problems. It is safe to say that almost every machine learning engineer started his/her journey with a simple linear regression model. 

Linear models can be used to model the dependence of a regression target variable y on some feature inputs X. The learned relationships are linear and can be written for a single instance  as follows:

**y = β0 + β1 x1 + … + βn Xn + ϵ**

y is the target variable that we want to be able to predict.

x1, x2,...Xn - features

β0  Intercept

β1, β2,..., βn are the coefficients for every feature input in the linear equation. Also referred to as weights.
