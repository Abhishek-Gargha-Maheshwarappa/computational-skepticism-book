# Linear Regression

A linear regression model predicts the target \(dependent variable\) as a weighted sum of the feature inputs \(independent variables\). The linearity of their relationship makes the interpretation easy. Linear regression models are very widely used by statisticians, computer scientists and other people who tackle quantitative problems. It is safe to say that almost every machine learning engineer started his/her journey with a simple linear regression model. 

Linear models can be used to model the dependence of a regression target variable y on some feature inputs X. The learned relationships are linear and can be written for a single instance  as follows:

**One Independent variable**

y = β0 + β1 x1

Where :

* ϵ -  mean-zero random error term
* y - Dependent variable 
* X - Independent variable
* β0 - Intercept is the expected value of Y when X = 0
* β1 - Slope is the average increase in Y associated with a one-unit increase in X

Multiple **Independent variables** 

It is called  multiple linear regression

 Y = β0 + β1X1+ β2X2+ β2X3+… + βkXn + **ϵ**

ϵ -  mean-zero random error term.
