# Assumptions





1. **Linearity**: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
2. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
3. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
4. **Normality**: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.
