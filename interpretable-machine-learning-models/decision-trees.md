# Decision Trees

Decision Tree is a non-parametric method, a supervised learning algorithm for classification problems.

Explaining the terminology related to the decision is not in the scope of this book, these can be read from [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)

Let use an example to understand how decision tree works

 How the decision tree will classify this

As can be seen, the node Overcast is pure since it has only one output that is to go for a run. So we now know that if the weather is the overcast person will go for a run. But if the weather is not overcast then if it is rainy or sunny doesn't have an output, it has yes or no. So needs further splitting it deduce it more.
