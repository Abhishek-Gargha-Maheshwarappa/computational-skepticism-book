# Decision Trees

Decision tree models allow model predictions to be visualized and allow users to explicitly see the decisions made in determining the prediction. As given in the name, these decisions are made in a tree format. Decision Tree is a non-parametric method, a supervised learning algorithm for classification problems.

The reason Decision Trees are prevalent is because they are easy to interpret. Humans can understand the decisions made by a Decision Tree model because that is also how humans make a decision.  

To understand the an example of Decision Trees in daily life, consider the following picture:

The Decision tree above depicts simple decision making that one would make. At every step in the tree, asking the right question either leads us to an answer or the next important question that will in turn lead us to an answer.

The key here is to find the most important features that impact a prediction and place them towards the root of the tree. As the tree deepens, we see nearly all the features that impact the model for all the predictions made by the model. 

Decision trees are widely used in Operations research and Operations management. There are many different algorithms that were developed based on the Decision Tree principle such as RandomForest, XGBoost, GBM, etc.
