# Model agonistic methods

**Readers note:** _**The book is not yet completed will be released in the last week of August**_

This section discusses a variety of model agnostic methods that can be applied to make machine learning models interpretable. 

All the techniques under this section can be applied to any model and each technique has its own pros and cons. We explain every technique technically and give a metaphorical example to help understand the underlying concept easily. 

At the end of every section, we have kept a small quiz for you to be able to evaluate if you have grasped the technique concept or not.
