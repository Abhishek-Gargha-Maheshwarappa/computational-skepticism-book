# Model agonistic methods

This section discusses a variety of model agnostic methods that can be applied to make machine learning models interpretable. 

By model-agnostic, we mean that the methods can be applied to any model. All the techniques under this section can be applied to any model and each technique has its own pros and cons. We explain every technique technically and give a metaphorical example to help understand the underlying concept easily.
