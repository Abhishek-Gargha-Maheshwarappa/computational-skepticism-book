# Random Forest

**What is a Random Forest?**

Random forest is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression. Random forests are a modification of bagging that builds a large collection of de-correlated trees and then averages them. This sometimes even called "feature bagging".

### **Model**

Random forest is applied to the automotive marketing dataset enables predicting lifetime value.

**Target** 

Customer Lifetime Value

The data is passed through preprocessing then it is trained using Scikit learn Library with RandomForestRegressor.Model hs the R2 score for Test dataset: 0.71.

Now since the model training and predicting is done now time to move ahead with Interpretation, for this model we will be using LIME for interpretation.

### **Implementation of Interpretability**
