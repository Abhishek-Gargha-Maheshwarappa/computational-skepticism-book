# Convolutional Neural Network

### Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a branch of machine learning algorithm that aims to make computers process, analyze images and videos and extract details in the same way a human eyes and minds do.  


### Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional Neural Network \(CNN\) is part of a Deep Neural Network which is generally used for image analysis.   


A CNN is a Deep Learning algorithm which takes in an input image, assigns importance to various features in the image and is able to differentiate one from the other. The preprocessing required for the CNN is very less compared to primitive filtering methods which were hand-engineered. On the other hand CNN has the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.
