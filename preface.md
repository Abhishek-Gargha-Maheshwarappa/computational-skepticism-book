# Preface

The book is for the Data scientist, any person who is interested in data science and have basic knowledge of model building. If you are interested in understanding how the model made a specific decision then this the right book for you.

The book aims to address the general idea of "Model Interpretability" and the novel topics around it. It gives a guide for a "hands-on" application of Model Interpretability techniques on different machine learning algorithms. The basic requirement of implementing Model Interpretability is the model itself, so through different examples, we will be creating models.

The focus will be on interpreting the model output and working to understand and explain why the model made particular decisions. This book will not focus on building machine learning models or explanations of the machine learning models. To make the best of the book, the reader should have prior knowledge of the machine models, industrial applications, how to deploy a model, and other foundational machine learning concepts.
