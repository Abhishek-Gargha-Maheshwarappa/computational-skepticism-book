# Preface

**Readers note:** _**The book is not yet completed will be released in the last week of August.**_

The book aims to address the general idea of "Model Interpretability" and the novel topics around it. It gives a guide for a "hands-on" application of Model Interpretability techniques on different machine learning algorithms. The basic requirement of implementing Model Interpretability is the model itself, so through different examples, we will be creating models and will showcase how to establish a brief explanation of the model employed. 

The focus will be on interpreting the model output and working to understand and explain why the model made particular decisions. This book will not focus on building machine learning models or explanations of the machine learning models. To make the best of the book, the reader should have prior knowledge of the machine models, industrial applications, how to deploy a model, and other foundational machine learning concepts.
