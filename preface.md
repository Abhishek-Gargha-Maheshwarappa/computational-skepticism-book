# Preface

The book aims to address the general idea of model interpretability and concerned topics. It gives a guide for the hands-on application of model interpretability techniques on different machine learning algorithms. The basic requirement of implementing model interpretability is the model itself, so indifferent examples we will be creating models and will contain a brief explanation of the model employed. 

The focus will be on interpreting the model output and working to understand and explain why the model made particular decisions. Book will not focus on building machine learning models or explanations of the machine learning models. To my the best of the book, the reader should have prior knowledge of the machine models, who are applied, which model to employ, and other foundational machine learning concepts.
