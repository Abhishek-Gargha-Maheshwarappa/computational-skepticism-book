# Preface

This book is for all Data scientists and Machine Learning engineers. Any person who is interested in data science and has a basic knowledge of model building. If you are interested in understanding how the model made a specific decision, then this is the right book for you.

The book aims to address the general idea of "Model Interpretability" and the novel topics around it. It gives a "[**hands-on**](implementation-of-these-techniques-on-different-models/)" approach to understand the working of Model Interpretability techniques on different machine learning algorithms. The basic requirement of implementing Model Interpretability is the model itself. So throughout our examples, we will be creating models.

The focus will be on interpreting the model output and working to understand and explain why the model made particular decisions. This book will not focus on building machine learning models. To make the best of the book, the reader should have prior knowledge of the machine models, industrial applications, how to deploy a model, and other foundational machine learning concepts.
